\section{Abstract}

This paper examines the influence of controversial source data on the training and performance of language models, with a specific focus on ethical, bias, and reliability aspects. By reviewing relevant literature and exploring different perspectives, the role of controversial data in shaping model behavior and proposing mitigation strategies for bias reduction will be discussed. And by the end, we will conclude with the importance of understanding the influence of such data and propose future research directions.
